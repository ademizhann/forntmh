    "text": "I’m truly impressed by the CheckAI service! It doesn’t just throw raw numbers from lab tests at you—it provides a detailed breakdown with clear explanations. For example, if your hemoglobin is slightly low, the AI doesn’t alarm you but calmly suggests: ‘This might be due to an iron deficiency—try adding buckwheat or pomegranate juice to your diet."
